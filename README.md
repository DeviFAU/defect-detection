**Defect Detection with ResNet-50 (PyTorch)**



This project implements a deep learning pipeline for automated defect detection in through-hole technology (THT) component images.  

The model is based on ResNet-50, trained with PyTorch, and evaluates performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix.





Features

\- Data preprocessing with augmentation (resize, rotation, flips, normalization)  

\- Training pipeline with \*\*ResNet-50\*\* adapted for binary classification (Good vs Defective)  

\- Learning rate scheduler and Adam optimizer for stable training  

\- Validation loop for accuracy monitoring  

\- Test evaluation with precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix visualization
